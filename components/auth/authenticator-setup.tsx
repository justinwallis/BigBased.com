// This file is intentionally left blank.
// It serves as a placeholder for future authenticator setup logic.
// You can add code here to configure your authenticator,
// such as setting up event listeners or initializing authentication providers.

// Example usage (remove this in production):
// logAuthEvent(AUTH_EVENTS.AUTHENTICATOR_INITIALIZED, { status: AUTH_STATUS.SUCCESS });
